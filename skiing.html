			<p>I have been interested by skiing since the age of 6, but didn't start right away, I was a little 
			scared at the start. But after a year, I decided to go try it out, that is when I started taking ski
			classes. After the first month I was able to go on the main hill, which was very scary. I remember
			the day when I stood at the top of it and was about to go down it. My brain paniced and I went straight 
			down. I was going super fast, but I realized how exicting it was going down the hill that fast. So
			I started training every year in the winter, trying to work on my basics of turning etc. Once I have 
			gotten into middle school I have mastered my parrallel turns. Middle school is when I started to 
			improve a lot. Every year our school would have a trip to quebec for a ski trip. That is when I started
			going on real hills, hills that were the size of mountains. Those trips were fun I was able to work on 
			my basics, but also putting them to the test. Now that leads us to 8th grade, in the winter, when the teachers
			went on strict, I went skiing with my 2 friends everytime there was a strike. This is when I learned to 
			conquer my fears. There was a terrain park there, so we decided to go on it. At the start we were scared of it
			so we took it slow, and we eventually went faster and faster down the jumps, to the point we mastered those techniques.
			Skiing has taught me a lot but the main lesson is that it helps me conquer my fears.
