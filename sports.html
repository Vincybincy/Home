			<p>I am an active kid, I love to play sports. I would play any sport anytime, but if I had to choose one 
			it would be badminton. I've been playing since I was 7 years old, I was in my backyard one afternoon and my dad
			introduced me to badminton. I have been playing it ever since. I have played in a few clubs before, which were
			Lee's Badminton club and Kevin Chen(kc) badminton club. I've also played for my middle school.
			Other than badminton, I play volleyball too, I've been playing ever since sixth grade. Volleyball has made me get 
			to know a lot more new people. Recently before the pandemic, I have been playing rep volleyball for the Toronto 
			Thunderbolts. Although I wasn't the best nor worst player, I have improved a lot since I start playing volleyball.
			Thunderbolts. Although I wasn't the best nor worst player, I have improved a lot since I start playing volleyball.
			I've also player soccer, but I only did that for fun, I had an interest for soccer since elementary school, but I
			only played for fun or leisure. I have played in a league, but that was for leisure too. I hope that this pandemic 
			will end faster so I can go outside and play sports.
